# In Python, we can establish new bindings using the assignment statement
# , which contains a name to the left of = and a value to the right:
radius = 10
print(radius)

# especially, Names are also bound via import statements.
from math import pi
print(pi)

# name can also be bound to functions.
f = max
print(f)
